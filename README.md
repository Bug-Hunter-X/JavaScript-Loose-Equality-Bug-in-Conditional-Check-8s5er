# JavaScript Loose Equality Bug

This repository demonstrates a common yet subtle bug in JavaScript related to loose equality (==) within conditional checks. The bug arises when attempting to distinguish between null and undefined values, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

## Bug Description

The provided JavaScript function `foo` aims to differentiate between `null`, `undefined`, and other values.  It uses loose equality (`==`) to compare the input with `null` and `undefined`.  However, loose equality has certain quirks that can lead to unexpected results, particularly when dealing with falsy values like 0 and false.

## Bug Solution

The solution involves replacing loose equality (`==`) with strict equality (`===`) to ensure accurate type and value comparisons.  This addresses the unexpected behavior by providing more precise checks for null and undefined values.
